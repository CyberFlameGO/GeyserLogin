## What is GeyserLogin?

GeyserLogin is a Geyser Extension that provides the ability to choose your username when logging
in through Geyser to a Java server.

Why get stuck with a username you picked 8 years ago?  Or if you share a device with another family
member you can now choose different usernames instead of sharing the same account.

Now you can allow your players the ability to choose a username when logging in. The last 5 logins are saved 
to allow easily switching between recent accounts.

This requires an offline server (for now). Security will need to be provided by a extension on the
server like with AuthMe.

## Quickstart

* Make sure you're running a build of Geyser that supports extensions. A bleeding edge version that does
can be found [here](https://github.com/bundabrg/Geyser/releases).

* Download [GeyserLogin](https://github.com/bundabrg/GeyserLogin/releases) and place it into a extensions folder
under your Geyser folder. Run Geyser and it will now pop up the following log dialogue when a player
connects:
