Why get stuck with a username you picked 8 years ago? Or if you share a device with another family member you can now choose different usernames instead of sharing the same account. Now you can allow your players the ability to choose a username when logging in. The last 5 logins are saved to allow easily switching between recent accounts. This requires an offline server (for now). Security will need to be provided by a extension on the server like with AuthMe. Quickstart \u00b6 Make sure you're running a build of Geyser that supports extensions. A bleeding edge version that does can be found here . Download GeyserLogin and place it into a extensions folder under your Geyser folder. Run Geyser and it will now pop up the following log dialogue when a player connects: Donations \u00b6 As this is an open source project it is free to use and free to modify. If you do wish to donate then you may use the following link with all funds going into my \"Evening Fund\". The Evening Fund is a fund I (bundabrg) have set up for all my open source projects. Anything sent there will be used to help others. I appreciate your contribution, and I thank you for giving me the ability to bring some happiness to others as well.
